      <pre class="doc">PRIVACY POLICY — AIR STRIKE ARCADE
Effective Date: February 15, 2026
Last Updated: February 15, 2026
Most current version (web): https://afkgamesstudio.github.io/afkgamestudio.github.io/air-strike-arcade/privacy-policy.html

1. SCOPE; ENTITY; ROLES
This Privacy Policy describes how AFK GAMES STUDIO (“Studio,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) processes information in connection with the mobile application Air Strike Arcade (the “App”).
The App is designed as an offline-first experience. We do not require account registration, and we do not directly request or collect information such as legal names, physical addresses, or account credentials.
However, the App uses third-party SDKs (including Google AdMob and Google Play Services) that may process identifiers and technical information (which may be considered “personal data” or “personal information” under certain laws) as described below.

2. INFORMATION PROCESSED ON YOUR DEVICE (OFFLINE-FIRST)

2.1 Local Game Data (ZERO Data). The App stores certain information locally on your device to provide core functionality for single-player gameplay, including CPU/AI difficulty and behavior data (the “ZERO” data) processed on-device.

2.2 User Controls (Local Deletion). Because the App is offline-first, App data described in Section 2.1 is stored locally on your device. You can delete local App data by:
Using the App’s in-game deletion control (e.g., a “Wipe Memory” / “Reset” button available in the main menu); and/or
Clearing the App’s storage/data via your device settings (typically: Settings → Apps → Air Strike Arcade → Storage → Clear storage/Clear data); and/or
Uninstalling the App, subject to your device and operating system backup settings.
Note: Clearing cache may remove temporary files but may not remove all locally stored App data, depending on OS behavior.

3. INFORMATION PROCESSED BY THIRD PARTIES (AUTOMATED COLLECTION)
The App integrates third-party SDKs for advertising and platform functionality. These third parties may automatically collect or receive certain information, which may include:
Advertising/Device Identifiers: Google Advertising ID (or equivalent identifiers), device identifiers, and app instance identifiers.
Network/Location Signals: IP address and approximate location inferred from IP.
Device/Technical Data: device model, hardware/OS version, language, time zone, App version, diagnostics, and performance data.
Advertising Data: ad impressions, clicks, ad interaction events, frequency capping signals, and anti-fraud signals.
We do not operate our own analytics or advertising servers for these functions; instead, third parties process this information under their own terms and policies and, in some cases, as independent controllers.

4. HOW INFORMATION IS USED
We use (or enable third parties to use) information to:
Provide and maintain App functionality (e.g., local gameplay operation and local data deletion controls).
Display, measure, and optimize ads; prevent fraud and abuse; enforce policy compliance.
Maintain security and stability (e.g., troubleshooting, crash/performance diagnostics).
Comply with legal obligations.

5. LEGAL BASES (EEA/UK)
Where GDPR/UK GDPR applies:
Consent: We rely on your consent for personalized advertising where required. Consent choices are managed through the Google User Messaging Platform (UMP) or equivalent in-app consent flow.
Legitimate Interests: We and/or our partners may process limited technical and security information to provide a secure and stable App, prevent fraud, and measure performance, subject to your rights and applicable law.
Contract Necessity: Local processing needed to provide the core offline App experience.

6. SHARING; THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

6.1 Advertising and Platform Partners. The App may share information with or allow collection by:
Google AdMob (advertising, measurement, fraud prevention)
Google Play Services (platform services and related functionality)
Your use of these services may be subject to Google’s terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third-party services.

6.2 Open Source. The App may include open source components governed by their respective licenses. See the App’s “Third-Party Notices” section.

7. YOUR CHOICES; PRIVACY RIGHTS

7.1 Consent & Ads Preferences (UMP). Where available, you can review or change ad consent choices using the in-app “Privacy Options” (or equivalent), which surfaces UMP choices.

7.2 Device Controls. Depending on your device and region, you may be able to reset or delete your Advertising ID and limit ad personalization through device settings (for example, by searching “Ads” or “Advertising” in system settings).

7.3 California (CCPA/CPRA). We do not “sell” personal information for money. Depending on how “share” is defined under applicable law, certain advertising-related disclosures may be considered “sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising. Where required, we provide an option to opt out via in-app “Privacy Options” or applicable device settings.

7.4 EEA/UK and Other Regions. Subject to applicable law, you may have rights to access, delete, or object to certain processing. To submit a request, contact us as described in Section 13. Please note that we may be unable to access or delete information held by third parties directly; in those cases, you must use the controls provided by the third party or your device settings.

8. DATA RETENTION
Local Game Data (ZERO Data) is retained on your device until you delete it using the App’s in-game deletion control, by clearing storage/data using OS controls, or by uninstalling the App (subject to OS backups).
Third-party data retention is governed by the third parties’ own policies and settings.

9. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
The App is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided information through the App, contact us and we will take appropriate steps consistent with applicable law.

10. SECURITY
We use reasonable administrative and technical measures designed to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

11. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
If you use the App outside the United States, information processed by third-party partners may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your own, including the United States, subject to the partners’ safeguards and policies and applicable law.

12. DATA DELETION (HOW TO DELETE DATA)

12.1 Local (on-device) deletion. You can delete local App data by using the App’s in-game deletion control (e.g., “Wipe Memory” / “Reset”), and/or by clearing storage/data in device settings, and/or uninstalling the App (subject to OS backup settings).

12.2 Third-party data. Some information may be processed by third-party SDKs (e.g., Google AdMob / Google Play Services). The Studio may not be able to directly access, delete, or control data held by third parties. Where available, use:
The App’s “Privacy Options” (Google UMP) to manage advertising consent/choices; and/or
Your device settings (e.g., reset/delete Advertising ID or limit ad personalization); and/or
The third party’s own controls and policies.

12.3 Requests. If you have a privacy or deletion request that applies to Studio-controlled processing, contact us using the details in Section 13.
