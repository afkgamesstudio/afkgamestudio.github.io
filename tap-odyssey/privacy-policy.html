    <section id="s1">
      <h2>1. Scope; Entity; Roles</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how AFK GAMES STUDIO (“Studio,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) processes information in connection with the mobile
        application Tap Odyssey (the “App”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The App is designed as an offline-first experience. We do not require account registration, and we do not directly request or collect
        information such as legal names, physical addresses, or account credentials.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the App uses third-party SDKs (including Google AdMob and Google Play Services) that may process identifiers and technical
        information (which may be considered “personal data” or “personal information” under certain laws) as described below.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="s2">
      <h2>2. Information Processed on Your Device (Offline-First)</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Local Game Data</h3>
      <p>
        The App stores certain information locally on your device to provide core functionality, such as gameplay progress, settings, and gameplay statistics.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 User Controls (Local Deletion)</h3>
      <p>
        Because the App is offline-first, most App data is stored locally on your device. You can delete local App data by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Clearing the App’s storage/data via your device settings (typically: Settings → Apps → Tap Odyssey → Storage → Clear storage/Clear data); and/or
        </li>
        <li>
          Uninstalling the App, subject to your device and operating system backup settings.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note: Clearing cache may remove temporary files but may not remove all locally stored gameplay data, depending on OS behavior.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="s3">
      <h2>3. Information Processed by Third Parties (Automated Collection)</h2>
      <p>
        The App integrates third-party SDKs for advertising and platform functionality. These third parties may automatically collect or receive
        certain information, which may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising/Device Identifiers:</strong> Google Advertising ID (or equivalent identifiers), device identifiers, and app instance identifiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Network/Location Signals:</strong> IP address and approximate location inferred from IP.</li>
        <li><strong>Device/Technical Data:</strong> device model, hardware/OS version, language, time zone, App version, diagnostics, and performance data.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising Data:</strong> ad impressions, clicks, ad interaction events, frequency capping signals, and anti-fraud signals.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not operate our own analytics or advertising servers for these functions; instead, third parties process this information under their own
        terms and policies and, in some cases, as independent controllers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="s4">
      <h2>4. How Information Is Used</h2>
      <p>We use (or enable third parties to use) information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide and maintain App functionality (e.g., saving local progress and settings).</li>
        <li>Display, measure, and optimize ads; prevent fraud and abuse; enforce policy compliance.</li>
        <li>Maintain security and stability (e.g., troubleshooting, crash/performance diagnostics).</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="s5">
      <h2>5. Legal Bases (EEA/UK)</h2>
      <p>Where GDPR/UK GDPR applies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Consent:</strong> We rely on your consent for personalized advertising where required. Consent choices are managed through the Google
          User Messaging Platform (UMP) or equivalent in-app consent flow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> We and/or our partners may process limited technical and security information to provide a secure and stable
          App, prevent fraud, and measure performance, subject to your rights and applicable law.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contract Necessity:</strong> Local processing needed to provide the core offline App experience.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="s6">
      <h2>6. Sharing; Third-Party Services</h2>

      <h3>6.1 Advertising and Platform Partners</h3>
      <p>The App may share information with or allow collection by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google AdMob (advertising, measurement, fraud prevention)</li>
        <li>Google Play Services (platform services and related functionality)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your use of these services may be subject to Google’s terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third-party services.
      </p>

      <h3>6.2 Open Source</h3>
      <p>
        The App may include open source components governed by their respective licenses. See the App’s “Third-Party Notices” section.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="s7">
      <h2>7. Your Choices; Privacy Rights</h2>

      <h3>7.1 Consent &amp; Ads Preferences (UMP)</h3>
      <p>
        Where available, you can review or change ad consent choices using the in-app “Privacy Options” (or equivalent), which surfaces UMP choices.
      </p>

      <h3>7.2 Device Controls</h3>
      <p>
        Depending on your device and region, you may be able to reset or delete your Advertising ID and limit ad personalization through device settings
        (for example, by searching “Ads” or “Advertising” in system settings).
      </p>

      <h3>7.3 California (CCPA/CPRA)</h3>
      <p>
        We do not “sell” personal information for money. Depending on how “share” is defined under applicable law, certain advertising-related disclosures
        may be considered “sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising. Where required, we provide an option to opt out via in-app “Privacy Options”
        or applicable device settings.
      </p>

      <h3>7.4 EEA/UK and Other Regions</h3>
      <p>
        Subject to applicable law, you may have rights to access, delete, or object to certain processing. To submit a request, contact us as described in
        Section 13. Please note that we may be unable to access or delete information held by third parties directly; in those cases, you must use the controls
        provided by the third party or your device settings.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="s8">
      <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Local Game Data is retained on your device until you delete it by clearing storage/data, using OS controls, or uninstalling the App (subject to OS backups).
      </p>
      <p>
        Third-party data retention is governed by the third parties’ own policies and settings.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="s9">
      <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The App is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has
        provided information through the App, contact us and we will take appropriate steps consistent with applicable law.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="s10">
      <h2>10. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable administrative and technical measures designed to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="s11">
      <h2>11. International Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        If you use the App outside the United States, information processed by third-party partners may be transferred to and processed in countries other than
        your own, including the United States, subject to the partners’ safeguards and policies and applicable law.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="s12">
      <h2>12. Data Deletion (How to Delete Data)</h2>

      <h3>12.1 Local (on-device) deletion</h3>
      <p>
        You can delete local App data by clearing storage/data in device settings and/or uninstalling the App (subject to OS backup settings).
      </p>

      <h3>12.2 Third-party data</h3>
      <p>
        Some information may be processed by third-party SDKs (e.g., Google AdMob / Google Play Services). The Studio may not be able to directly access,
        delete, or control data held by third parties. Where available, use:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The App’s “Privacy Options” (Google UMP) to manage advertising consent/choices; and/or</li>
        <li>Your device settings (e.g., reset/delete Advertising ID or limit ad personalization); and/or</li>
        <li>The third party’s own controls and policies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>12.3 Requests</h3>
      <p>
        If you have a privacy or deletion request that applies to Studio-controlled processing, contact us using the details in Section 13.
