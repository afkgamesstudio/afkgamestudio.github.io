    <section id="scope">
      <h2>1. Scope; Entity; Roles</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>AFK GAMES STUDIO</strong> (“Studio,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) processes information
        in connection with the mobile application <strong>XO Arcade: Infinity Edition</strong> (the “App”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The App is designed as an <strong>offline-first</strong> experience. We do not require account registration,
        and we do not directly request or collect information such as legal names, physical addresses, or account credentials.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the App uses third-party SDKs (e.g., <strong>Google AdMob</strong> and <strong>Google Play Services</strong>)
        that may process identifiers and technical information (which may be considered “personal data” or “personal information”
        under certain laws) as described below.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="local-data">
      <h2>2. Information Processed on Your Device (Offline-First)</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Local Game Data</h3>
      <p>The App stores certain information locally on your device to provide core functionality, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Game State:</strong> progress, settings, and gameplay statistics.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>ZERO Protocol Data:</strong> gameplay telemetry used to adjust CPU difficulty and gameplay behavior locally.
          This data is <strong>non-biometric</strong> and is processed on-device.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 User Controls (Local Deletion)</h3>
      <p>
        You can delete local game data using in-game functions such as <strong>“Wipe Memory”</strong> and/or <strong>“Reset Stats”</strong>.
        Uninstalling the App typically removes locally stored data, subject to your device and operating system backup settings.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="third-parties">
      <h2>3. Information Processed by Third Parties (Automated Collection)</h2>
      <p>
        The App integrates third-party SDKs for advertising and platform functionality. These third parties may automatically
        collect or receive certain information, which may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising/Device Identifiers:</strong> Google Advertising ID (or equivalent identifiers), device identifiers, and app instance identifiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Network/Location Signals:</strong> IP address and approximate location inferred from IP.</li>
        <li><strong>Device/Technical Data:</strong> device model, hardware/OS version, language, time zone, app version, diagnostics, and performance data.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising Data:</strong> ad impressions, clicks, ad interaction events, and anti-fraud signals.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not operate our own analytics or advertising servers for these functions; instead, third parties process this information
        under their own terms and policies and, in some cases, as independent controllers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="use">
      <h2>4. How Information Is Used</h2>
      <p>We use (or enable third parties to use) information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide and maintain App functionality (e.g., saving local progress and settings).</li>
        <li>Improve gameplay experience (e.g., adjusting CPU difficulty using on-device ZERO Protocol data).</li>
        <li>Display, measure, and optimize ads; prevent fraud and abuse; enforce policy compliance.</li>
        <li>Maintain security and stability (e.g., troubleshooting, crash/performance diagnostics).</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="legal-bases">
      <h2>5. Legal Bases (EEA/UK)</h2>
      <p>Where GDPR/UK GDPR applies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Consent:</strong> We rely on your consent for personalized advertising where required. Consent choices are managed
          through the Google User Messaging Platform (UMP) or equivalent in-app consent flow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> We and/or our partners may process limited technical and security information to provide
          a secure and stable App, prevent fraud, and measure performance, subject to your rights and applicable law.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contract Necessity:</strong> Local processing needed to provide the core offline App experience (e.g., saving progress locally).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="sharing">
      <h2>6. Sharing; Third-Party Services</h2>

      <h3>6.1 Advertising and Platform Partners</h3>
      <p>The App may share information with or allow collection by:</p>
      <ul>

        <li><strong>Google Play Services</strong> (platform services and related functionality)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your use of these services may be subject to Google’s terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third-party services.

      <h2>7. Your Choices; Privacy Rights</h2>

      <h3>7.1 Consent &amp; Ads Preferences (UMP)</h3>
      <p>
        Where available, you can review or change ad consent choices using the in-app <strong>“Privacy Options”</strong> (or equivalent)

      </p>

      <h3>7.3 California (CCPA/CPRA)</h3>
      <p>
        We do not “sell” personal information for money. Depending on how “share” is defined under applicable law, certain advertising-related
        disclosures may be considered “sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising. Where required, we provide an option to opt out of such
        “sale” or “sharing” via in-app <strong>“Privacy Options”</strong> or applicable device settings. California residents may also have rights
        to access, delete, or correct certain personal information, subject to verification and legal exceptions.
      </p>

      <h3>7.4 EEA/UK and Other Regions</h3>
      <p>
        Subject to applicable law, you may have rights to access, delete, or object to certain processing. To submit a request, contact us as described
        in Section 13. Please note that we may be unable to access or delete information held by third parties directly; in those cases, you must use

    </section>

    <section id="retention">
      <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>

    <section id="children">
      <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>

        If you believe a child has provided information through the App, contact us and we will take appropriate steps consistent with applicable law.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="security">
      <h2>10. Security</h2>
      <p>

    </section>

    <section id="international">
      <h2>11. International Transfers</h2>
      <p>

    </section>

    <section id="data-deletion">
      <h2>12. Data Deletion (How to Delete Data)</h2>

      <h3>12.1 Local (On-Device) Deletion</h3>
      <p>
        Because the App is offline-first, most App data is stored locally on your device. You can delete local game data by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using in-app controls such as <strong>“Wipe Memory”</strong> and/or <strong>“Reset Stats”</strong>; and/or</li>
        <li>Uninstalling the App (subject to your device/OS backup settings).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>12.2 Third-Party Data</h3>
      <p>
        Some information may be processed by third-party SDKs (e.g., Google AdMob / Google Play Services). The Studio may not be able to directly access,
        delete, or control data held by third parties. Where available, use:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The App’s <strong>“Privacy Options”</strong> (Google UMP) to manage advertising consent/choices; and/or</li>
        <li>Your device settings (e.g., reset/delete Advertising ID or limit ad personalization); and/or</li>
        <li>The third party’s own controls and policies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>12.3 Requests</h3>
      <p>
        If you have a privacy or deletion request that applies to Studio-controlled processing, contact us using the details in Section 13.
