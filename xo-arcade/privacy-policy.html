        <h2>Privacy Policy (Full Text)</h2>

        <pre class="legal-text">PRIVACY POLICY — XO ARCADE: INFINITY EDITION
Effective Date: February 19, 2026
Last Updated: February 19, 2026

Most current version (web):
https://afkgamesstudio.github.io/xo-arcade/privacy-policy.html

This Privacy Policy is provided in-app and may also be available on the Studio website. If a web copy differs from the in-app copy included with your installed build, the in-app copy controls for that build.

1. SCOPE; ENTITY; ROLES
This Privacy Policy describes how AFK GAMES STUDIO (“Studio,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) processes information in connection with the mobile application XO Arcade: Infinity Edition (the “App”).

The App is designed as an offline-first experience. We do not require account registration, and we do not directly request or collect information such as legal names, physical addresses, or account credentials.

However, the App uses third-party SDKs and services that may collect and process certain information automatically, including:
- Google AdMob / Google Mobile Ads SDK (ads and measurement)
- Google User Messaging Platform (UMP) (consent / privacy options flow where required/available)
- Firebase Analytics (app usage measurement)
- Firebase Crashlytics (crash reporting and stability diagnostics)

For certain third-party processing, Google may act as an independent controller under its own terms and policies. See Section 6.

2. INFORMATION PROCESSED ON YOUR DEVICE (OFFLINE-FIRST)

2.1 Local Game Data
The App stores certain information locally on your device to provide core functionality, including:
- Game State: progress, settings, and gameplay statistics
- ZERO Protocol Data: gameplay telemetry used to adjust CPU difficulty and gameplay behavior locally (processed on-device; non-biometric)

2.2 User Controls (Local Deletion)
You can delete local game data using in-game functions such as “Wipe Memory” and/or “Reset Stats.” Uninstalling the App typically removes locally stored data, subject to your device and operating system backup settings.

3. INFORMATION PROCESSED BY THIRD PARTIES (AUTOMATED COLLECTION)
The App integrates third-party SDKs for advertising, consent, analytics, and crash reporting. These third parties may automatically collect, receive, and/or process information such as:

A) Device or Other Identifiers
- Advertising ID (or equivalent identifiers), device identifiers, and app instance identifiers

B) Approximate Location
- IP address and approximate location inferred from IP

C) App Interactions
- App interaction and usage events (e.g., app launches, screens viewed, feature usage)
- Advertising events (e.g., ad impressions, clicks, interaction signals)

D) Diagnostics
- Device/technical data such as device model, hardware/OS version, language, time zone, app version
- Performance/diagnostics signals (including anti-fraud and security-related signals for ads)

E) Crash Logs
- Crash reports and related diagnostic information (e.g., stack traces and crash-state signals) processed via Firebase Crashlytics to diagnose and fix stability issues

We do not operate our own user-account servers for these functions; instead, third parties process information under their own terms and policies and, in some cases, as independent controllers.

4. HOW INFORMATION IS USED
We use information (or enable third parties to use information) to:
- Provide and maintain App functionality (e.g., saving local progress and settings)
- Improve gameplay experience (e.g., adjusting CPU difficulty using on-device ZERO Protocol Data)
- Display, measure, and optimize ads; prevent fraud and abuse; enforce policy compliance
- Measure and understand app usage (analytics/measurement)
- Maintain security and stability (e.g., troubleshooting, crash/performance diagnostics)
- Comply with legal obligations

5. LEGAL BASES (EEA/UK)
Where GDPR/UK GDPR applies, processing may occur under:
- Consent: for personalized advertising where required; consent choices are managed through UMP (see Section 7)
- Legitimate Interests: limited processing for security, fraud prevention, measurement, and stability, subject to your rights and applicable law
- Contract Necessity: local processing needed to provide the core offline App experience (e.g., saving progress locally)

6. SHARING; THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

6.1 Third-Party SDKs and Service Providers
The App uses third-party SDKs and service providers that collect and/or process information described in this Privacy Policy:
- Google AdMob / Google Mobile Ads SDK (advertising, measurement, fraud prevention)
- Google User Messaging Platform (UMP) (consent and privacy options flow)
- Firebase Analytics (app usage measurement)
- Firebase Crashlytics (crash reporting and stability diagnostics)

These services are provided by Google LLC (including Firebase). Your use of these services is subject to Google’s terms and privacy policies. Depending on the service and context, Google may process certain information as an independent controller under its own policies.

6.2 “Sharing” for Advertising (where applicable)
For advertising-related processing, certain disclosures may be considered “sharing” under some laws (e.g., cross-context behavioral advertising). Where required, we provide choices via UMP “Privacy Options” and/or device settings.

6.3 Crash Logs (Firebase Crashlytics)
Crash logs are collected and processed to diagnose and fix stability issues. Crash logs are not shared with non-Google third parties for advertising.

6.4 Open Source
The App may include open source components governed by their respective licenses. See the App’s “Third-Party Notices” section.

7. YOUR CHOICES; PRIVACY RIGHTS

7.1 Consent &amp; Ads Preferences (UMP)
Where available, you can review or change ad consent choices using the in-app “Privacy Options” (or equivalent), which surfaces UMP choices. Depending on your region and choices, ads may be personalized or non-personalized. Some processing may still occur for measurement, security, and fraud prevention as permitted by applicable law and platform rules.

7.2 Device Controls
Depending on your device and region, you may be able to reset or delete your Advertising ID and limit ad personalization through device settings (for example, by searching “Ads” or “Advertising” in system settings).

7.3 California (CCPA/CPRA)
We do not “sell” personal information for money. Depending on how “share” is defined under applicable law, certain advertising-related disclosures may be considered “sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising. Where required, we provide an option to opt out of such “sale” or “sharing” via in-app “Privacy Options” or applicable device settings. California residents may also have rights to access, delete, or correct certain personal information, subject to verification and legal exceptions.

7.4 EEA/UK and Other Regions
Subject to applicable law, you may have rights to access, delete, or object to certain processing. To submit a request applicable to Studio-controlled processing, contact us as described in Section 13. Please note that we may be unable to access or delete information held by third parties directly; in those cases, you must use the controls provided by the third party or your device settings.

8. DATA RETENTION
- Local Game Data is retained on your device until you delete it using in-app controls or uninstall the App (subject to OS backups).
- Third-party data retention is governed by the third parties’ own policies and settings.

9. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
The App is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided information through the App, contact us and we will take appropriate steps consistent with applicable law.

10. SECURITY
We use reasonable administrative and technical measures designed to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

11. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
If you use the App outside the United States, information processed by third-party partners may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your own, including the United States, subject to the partners’ safeguards and policies and applicable law.

12. DATA DELETION (HOW TO DELETE DATA)

12.1 Local (On-Device) Deletion
Because the App is offline-first, most App data is stored locally on your device. You can delete local game data by:
- Using in-app controls such as “Wipe Memory” and/or “Reset Stats”; and/or
- Uninstalling the App (subject to your device/OS backup settings).

12.2 Third-Party Data
Some information may be processed by third-party SDKs (e.g., Google AdMob, UMP, Firebase Analytics, Firebase Crashlytics). The Studio may be unable to directly access, delete, or control data held by third parties. Where available, use:
- The App’s “Privacy Options” (UMP) to manage advertising consent/choices; and/or
- Your device settings (e.g., reset/delete Advertising ID or limit ad personalization); and/or
- The third party’s own controls and policies.

12.3 Requests
If you have a privacy or deletion request that applies to Studio-controlled processing, contact us using the details in Section 13.
