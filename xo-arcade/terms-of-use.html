    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>9. Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration; Class Action Waiver</h2>
        <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>9.1 Informal Resolution and Notice of Dispute.</strong> Before initiating arbitration or any court proceeding (except small claims court), you agree to first send the Studio a written Notice of Dispute to <a href="mailto:afkstudios.dev@gmail.com">afkstudios.dev@gmail.com</a> with the subject line “Notice of Dispute – XO Arcade.” The Notice must include (a) your name and contact information, (b) a description of the dispute, and (c) the relief you seek. The parties agree to attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received.</p>
        <p><strong>9.2 Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong> If the dispute is not resolved within the 30-day period, you and the Studio agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to the App or these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by these Terms. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
        <p><strong>9.3 Arbitration Location and Procedure.</strong> Arbitration will be conducted remotely by video or telephone unless the arbitrator determines an in-person hearing is necessary. If an in-person hearing is required, it will take place in Orange County, Florida, unless the AAA rules or the arbitrator provide otherwise. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, except that courts of competent jurisdiction may determine the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver.</p>
        <p><strong>9.4 Fees and Costs.</strong> Payment of arbitration fees will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules and applicable law.</p>
        <p><strong>9.5 Small Claims.</strong> Either party may bring an individual action in small claims court in lieu of arbitration, provided the action remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual basis.</p>
        <p><strong>9.6 Class Action Waiver.</strong> YOU AND THE STUDIO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS OR PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>
        <p><strong>9.7 Opt-Out.</strong> You may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of your first use of the App by emailing <a href="mailto:afkstudios.dev@gmail.com">afkstudios.dev@gmail.com</a> with the subject line “Arbitration Opt-Out” and providing (a) your name, (b) the email address you use (if any), and (c) a clear statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration. If you opt out, you and the Studio agree that disputes will be resolved in court as set forth in Section 11.1, and the Class Action Waiver in Section 9.6 will not apply to you.</p>
        <p><strong>9.8 Administrator Unavailability.</strong> If AAA is unavailable to administer arbitration, the parties will reasonably cooperate to select an alternative arbitration administrator that applies consumer arbitration rules substantially similar to the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>10. Termination</h2>
        <p>The Studio may suspend or terminate your access to the App and this license at any time if you violate these Terms or if the Studio reasonably determines your use is unlawful, harmful, or abusive. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the App and delete any copies in your possession or control. Sections 3.2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 survive termination.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>11. General Terms</h2>
        <p><strong>11.1 Governing Law; Venue.</strong> These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Florida, USA, without regard to conflict of laws principles. To the extent a dispute is not subject to arbitration (including if you validly opt out under Section 9.7), you agree that any such action will be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Orange County, Florida, and you consent to personal jurisdiction and venue there. Mandatory consumer protection rights that cannot be waived under applicable law remain unaffected.</p>
        <p><strong>11.2 Severability.</strong> If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p>
        <p><strong>11.3 Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and Third-Party Notices, constitute the entire agreement between you and the Studio regarding the App and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements and understandings.</p>
        <p><strong>11.4 Assignment.</strong> You may not assign or transfer these Terms without the Studio’s prior written consent. The Studio may assign these Terms (including all rights and obligations) in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or by operation of law.</p>
        <p><strong>11.5 No Waiver.</strong> The Studio’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
        <p><strong>11.6 Interpretation.</strong> Headings are for convenience only and do not affect interpretation. The word “including” means “including without limitation.”</p>
